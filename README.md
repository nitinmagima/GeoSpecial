## Overview

This application allows users to:
- Analyze **historical cyclone tracks**
- Model **forward-looking scenarios** using Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) modeling
- Assess **infrastructure and population exposure**
- Explore **AI-driven vulnerability hotspots**
- Align sectoral risks across time using a **crisis timeline**
- Interact with an **AI chatbot assistant** for response planning
- Monitor live **alerts and forecasts**

Every second counts during a disaster â€” this platform helps decision-makers act early, communicate efficiently, and prioritize children in high-risk zones.
